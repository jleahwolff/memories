 Memories

What would you think of an app that stores all your photos, videos, books, letters, documents, music, etc.? But not just stores them, keeps them readily accessible, right at your fingertips. Allows you to share them across across social media platforms, or directly in app, among your friends and family. An app that is accessible, user-friendly, and customizable to you. This, is Memories.

Imagine being able to recall a family photo, a report card from college years, or an original artwork from your childhood.  Could you do this by scrolling through thousands of tiny photos on your phone?  How about being able to call back these memories with a word?  Kindergarten. Report Card. Family. Organize your memories, and share them with family and friends.  Ressurect the boxes of precious goods in your attic, and bring those memories back to life!

What we need to accomplish for the project includes:
1. A landing page
2. An About page, including a in-depth description of the app, and who the developers are.
3. Sign-Up/Login page where they can access their information from the computer
4. A way to connect thier information to the cloud, and connect friends to the files
5. A profile page, with the information about the person and different files / books / chapters of the person's life.
